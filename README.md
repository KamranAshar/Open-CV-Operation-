1. Object Detection:-

Object detection in deep learning is about finding and pinpointing multiple objects in images or videos. It goes beyond just recognizing what's in a picture by also marking where each object is with a box. This helps in tasks like self-driving cars, security cameras, and sorting through large collections of photos quickly and accurately.

2. OpenCV :-

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular open-source library for computer vision and image processing tasks. It provides a set of tools and functions that help developers manipulate and analyze visual data, such as images and videos. OpenCV is widely used in various applications, including robotics, augmented reality, face recognition, and medical imaging, due to its versatility and extensive capabilities in handling and processing visual information.

3. OpenCV Operations:-

- Resize: Resizes an image to a specified width and height.
- Crop: Cuts out a portion of an image based on specified coordinates.
- Blur: Applies a blur effect to reduce noise and detail in an image.
- Grayscale Conversion: Converts a color image to grayscale for simpler processing.
- Histogram Equalization: Enhances the contrast of an image by adjusting the intensity distribution.
- Normalization: Scales pixel values to a specified range to improve consistency in image data.
- Rotation: Rotates an image by a specified angle.
- Thresholding: Converts an image into a binary image based on pixel intensity threshold values.
- Edge Detection: Identifies sharp changes in intensity to highlight edges in an image.
- Morphological Operations: Analyzes and processes shapes within an image, such as erosion and dilation.
